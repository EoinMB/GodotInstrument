This game/ instument was made in Godot for my Game Programming module. All of the assets and programming were done by me, specifically for this project.
The game is designed to be played on an n64 controller, but can also be played on a regular gamepad or a keyboard. It can also be played on android devices.

With every button press, the character emits a sound and particle, and changes animation.

The pitch of the flute can also be adjusted, providing a wider range of notes.
